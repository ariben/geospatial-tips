# Three useful tips on how to effectively use Geospatial data in Python

## A walkthrough tutorial, code and examples on how to easily integrate Geospatial data in your data science projects.

In the Geospatial world, it is commonly used the "80% of data is geographic" phrase. Although we can not prove that, lately we see widespread availability of Geospatial datasets.

Handling Geographic data is not that easy though. It requires domain knowledge to handle Geometries and Geographic projections. I mainly work with Geospatial data, and in this article, I will show you three ways you can handle geospatial data effectively and easily in Python.

If You have a dataset with latitude and longitude columns, most probably you know you can plot in a map. But is that it? Do you call it a day? And maybe explore other non-locational features.

There is a more systematic and effective way you can work with Geographic data in Python. In this tutorial, I explore how you can efficiently work with location data in Python, enrich your dataset and explore it with specific tools for spatial data in Python.

## 1. Convert your data to GeoDataFrame

## 2. Know your Coordinates

## 3. Enrich your data with Spatial join
